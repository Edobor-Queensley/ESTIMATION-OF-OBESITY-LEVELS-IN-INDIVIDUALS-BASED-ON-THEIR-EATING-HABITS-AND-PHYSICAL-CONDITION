Estimation of Obesity Levels Using Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning project that uses K-Means and Hierarchical clustering to identify obesity-related patterns from dietary, physical activity, and demographic data. After preprocessing, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction with PCA, four meaningful clusters were identified, with K-Means providing the best cluster separation. The results highlight how clustering can support data-driven obesity risk assessment and targeted health interventions
